# UNDER CONSTRUCTION CURRENTLY WORKING ON THE LEXER

# Nullang
A programming language, with its own lexer, parser and ect! Made from scratch

# Why should I use Nullang
You don't have to, this is only a hobby project
Buuuut If you do, Nullang is a mix between the speed of C and the easy syntax of Python

# Features
- Hand-made compiler
- Special file type example.nu
- Completely Open-Source and made in C and Assembly
- A one-man project, I am more than happy for help or suggestions
